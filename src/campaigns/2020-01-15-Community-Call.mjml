            <h1>Bringing old manuscripts to life</h1>

            <p>It's ALIIIIIIIVE! Well‚Ä¶ the data can be, at least.</p>

            <p>
              There is a treasure-trove full of historic papers which have been
              written and published with traditional mediums in mind.
              Some of these manuscripts go on to be cited in hundreds of new papers,
              and become enmeshed within the fabric of certain fields.
              Though, as we‚Äôve <a href="https://stenci.la/blog/2018-07-03-elife-article/">discussed
                in the past</a>, relying on tiny morsels of unverifiable data
              frozen in time is not good enough.

              We believe the ability to take a published piece of work, and
              easily modernize it to meet demands of contemporary researchers
              with features such as interactive figures and code-cells can be a
              catalyst for innovative new work and ideas.
            </p>

            <p>
              Tomorrow we will demonstrate a preliminary workflow for
              ‚Äúenlivening‚Äù an existing research paper during our <a href="https://zoom.us/j/661626102">community call</a>.
              Going from a published online article, to an word-processor,
              adding interactivity and reproducibility, and re-publishing for
              the world to see.
            </p>

              Thank you, and happy new year from everyone at Stencila!<br /> üéä
